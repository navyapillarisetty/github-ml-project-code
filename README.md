Use of different predicting models on the energy dataset to know which model works better on the dataset based on the metrics
In this project I have used different predicting models like Recurrent Neural Networks with GRU, Recurrent Neural Networks with LSTM, SimpleRNN, Convolutional Neural Networks, Feedforward Neural Networks, XGBoost Regressor, Linear Regression Model and ARIMA on all 44 countries within the Energy dataset.
